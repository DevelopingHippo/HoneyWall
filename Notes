Infrastructure:

Fix docker-compose.yml file:
- change default ports for MySQL
- Decide on which route to take (1 Database for both applications, or 2 separate databases)


MySQL Database:
- Create database layout for Website
- Create database layout for Application
- Create username and passwords for both and figure out a proper way to store them through Docker secrets



Website:
- Generate LetsEncrypt pem + key on startup
- Website Layout
    - Profile Page (Password Reset + Profile Image + etc.)
    - Dashboard (Javascript Graphs)
    - Admin Panel


Setting up for Docker Launch for Website Testing:
git clone https://github.com/DevelopingHippo/HoneyWall
cd HoneyWall/Website/
docker build -t web-test .
docker run -p 443:443 -d web-test
